## üìò Overview

Compressed Sensing (CS) enables the reconstruction of sparse signals from far fewer measurements than traditionally required. This project implements and analyzes binary measurement matrices based on expander graphs, which are memory-efficient and computationally faster alternatives to the baselines, random Gaussian matrices.

## üìÅ Contents

- `Code/`: Python scripts and notebooks for simulation
- `Images/`: Mathematical derivations and LaTeX write-ups
- `Project_Proposal.pdf`: Initial deliverables promised at the beginning of the project
- `Report.pdf`: Final report in IEEE format containing detailed mathematical proofs, results and conclusion
- `README.md`: This file

---

## Methodology

The results in the paper were reproduced in the following fashion. For the purpose of measurement matrices:

- `Array Code` (LDPC - Low Density Parity Checker)
- `Euler Matrix`
- `Guassian Matrix`

The reconstruction was evaluated by compressing the original signal and then by using the following metrics

- `Timing Analysis`
- `Phase Transition Analysis`
- `Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM)`
